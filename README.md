This is a set of apps which creates the same application in various 
Python web micro-frameworks. 

The app(s) talks to Facebook, and finds out recent people
who have posted a public status with the text "so starving".

This idea came from reading [Onion](http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-am-so-starving-vs-i-am-so-starving,11541/).

We have the same app in 

[appengine](http://code.google.com/appengine/)
[flask](http://flask.pocoo.com/)
[web.py](http://webpy.org/)
[juno](https://github.com/breily/juno)
[bottle](http://bottle.paws.de/docs/dev/index.html)
[itty]
[django](http://djangoproject.com/)
